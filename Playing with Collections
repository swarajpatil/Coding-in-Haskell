Create List
// List of 1 to 20
[1,2..20]

// List of even numbers between 1 to 20
[2,4..20]

// take 5 element from list
take 5 ([1,2..20])

// perform some operation on each element of list -- similar to map in scala
// square number between  1 to 10
[ x * x | x <-[1,2..10] ]


take 5 (repeat 10)

replicate 3 10 returns [10,10,10]

//zip to combine two lists

zip [1,2,3,4,5] [5,5,5,5,5]  //[(1,5),(2,5),(3,5),(4,5),(5,5)]
